# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Shift+drag column selection when reorder is enabled**: When `isColumnReorderAllowed` is true, plain drag on headers starts column reorder, making drag-to-select columns impossible. Now holding Shift bypasses reorder and starts column selection drag instead. Shift+click also sets up drag listeners so the selection can be extended by dragging further.

### Docs

- **Dropdown demo: dynamic cell styling** — Priority column now shows colored background per value using `cellClassCallback` + `customStylesCallback`, with `formatCallback` rendering colored dots in display mode
- **Fill handle demo: fixed endless grid appearance** — Changed vertical/horizontal fill demo grids from `max-width: 100%` to `max-width: fit-content` so they don't stretch with a filler column
- **Selection demo: updated column selection instructions** — Reflects Shift+Click/Drag for column selection when reorder is enabled

### Fixed

- **Dropdown not closing on column/row header click**: Clicking a column header or row number while a dropdown (or editor) was open left the dropdown/edit state dangling. Root cause: header and row-number click handlers bypassed the action pipeline, so no cleanup ran. Fix: Added centralized `cleanupEditState()` helper that closes dropdowns, cancels edits, clears focused cell, and removes fill handle — called from both `handleHeaderMouseDown` and `handleRowNumberMouseDown`.
- **Dropdown staying open when clicking another cell**: In `editTrigger: 'always'` mode, clicking a different cell while a dropdown was open didn't close the dropdown. Root cause: `mapMouseDownToActions` only emitted `focusCell` for non-toggle cell clicks — no `closeDropdown`. Fix: prepend `closeDropdown` action when `dropdownOpen && !isToggleClick`.
- **`shouldShowDropdownOnFocus` not working**: The `shouldShowDropdownOnFocus` property was defined but never wired up. Dropdown editors (select/combobox/autocomplete) in `editTrigger: 'always'` mode now auto-open the dropdown when a cell receives focus (via click, Tab, arrow keys), if `shouldShowDropdownOnFocus` is `true` (the default). Explicit edit actions (click, dblclick, F2, Space) always open the dropdown regardless of this setting.
- **Column selection visual not clearing on cell click**: Clicking a data cell while a column was selected didn't remove the selection highlight from the header. Two root causes: (1) In `editTrigger: 'always'`/editing path, `clearSelection` was only dispatched for cell range selections, not row/column selections. (2) The selection executor used wrong CSS class name (`wg__header-cell--selected`) — the renderer applies `wg__header--selected`. Fixed both the dispatch condition and the class name.
- **No focus border in click/dblclick edit modes**: Clicking a cell in `editTrigger: 'click'` or `'dblclick'` mode showed the fill handle (proving focus was set) but no focus outline. Root cause: focus border CSS was scoped to `.wg--navigate-mode`, which is only added when `editTrigger === 'navigate'`. Fix: removed the navigate-mode guard — `.wg__cell--focused` outline now works in all editable modes.
- **Focused cell persists after clicking header/row number**: The focused cell's outline and fill handle remained visible after clicking a column header or row number to select. Fix: `cleanupEditState()` now also clears `focusedCell` state, removes the focus visual, and removes the fill handle.
- **Click-after-dropdown requires double click in click/dblclick modes**: In `editTrigger: 'dblclick'` (or `'click'`), opening a dropdown then clicking another cell only closed the dropdown — the new cell didn't get focused until a second click. Root cause: `cancelEdit` re-renders the old cell (removing its editor), which triggers `focusout`; the deferred `handleTableFocusOut` handler then clears the focus that `focusCell` just set. Fix: set `isTransitioningCells` flag before `cancelEdit` in the non-always path, and ensure cells get `tabindex="-1"` for programmatic focus.
- **Select dropdown not opening in `editTrigger: 'always'` mode**: Clicking a select cell opened the dropdown briefly but it immediately closed. Root cause: legacy click handler on `.wg__select-trigger` called `toggleDropdown()`, closing the dropdown that the pipeline had just opened on mousedown. Fix: skip legacy handler when the cell's editTrigger is `'always'` (pipeline handles it via `shouldShowDropdownOnFocus`).
- **Focus border not clearing on outside click in 'always' mode**: Clicking outside the grid left the `wg__cell--always-edit-focused` class on the last focused cell. Fix: outsideClick handler now removes both `wg__cell--focused` and `wg__cell--always-edit-focused`.
- **Dropdown filtering leaks between cells in 'always' mode**: Clicking from a combobox cell (e.g., Department="Engineering") to a select cell (e.g., Status) caused the Status dropdown to show zero options. Root cause: `updateFocusVisual` called `renderCell` on the old combobox cell, which set `ctx.filterText` to the current input value; the subsequent `openDropdownForCurrentEditor` for the new cell filtered its options against this stale text. Fix: in 'always' mode, `updateFocusVisual` only removes CSS classes from the old cell instead of re-rendering it.
- **Dropdown still filtered after selecting combobox value then clicking select cell**: Even with the `updateFocusVisual` fix above, selecting a value from a combobox dropdown (e.g., Department) and then clicking a select cell (e.g., Status) still showed zero options. Root cause: `selectDropdownOption` calls `renderCell` to show the committed value, and `renderComboboxEditor` sets `ctx.filterText` to the input's display value as a side effect — this stale text then filtered the next cell's options to zero. Fix: clear `ctx.filterText` in the focus executor when focusing a different cell.
- **Autocomplete search firing after switching cells**: Typing in an autocomplete cell and quickly clicking another cell could trigger a stale search request after focus moved. Fix: cancel pending `searchDebounceTimer` and abort in-flight `searchAbortController` when focusing a different cell.
- **Tab in navigate mode selects dropdown option instead of traversing**: In `editTrigger: 'navigate'` with `shouldShowDropdownOnFocus`, Tab/Shift+Tab always cancelled the dropdown — even when the user had arrowed to a different option. Added `dropdownUserInteracted` flag to distinguish auto-opened dropdowns (Tab traverses without selecting) from user-navigated dropdowns (Tab selects and moves). Also fixed `justSelected` flag blocking the next cell's dropdown from opening after Tab-selecting an option via `thenNavigate`.
- **Select/dropdown cell value cleared on Tab in input-matrix mode**: In `editTrigger: 'always'` mode, tabbing through a select/dropdown cell cleared its value. Root cause: the transition executor commits every cell on transition, reading the value from the editor's `data-value` attribute — but `renderSelectEditor` never set `data-value` on the trigger element, so the committed value was always empty string. Fix: add `data-value` attribute to the select trigger HTML so the original value is preserved during tab-through.
- **Row number invisible on selected rows in navigate mode**: In editable grids with `editTrigger: 'navigate'`, the selected row number cell's accent background was overridden by the read-only cell background rule (`.wg--editable.wg--navigate-mode .wg__cell:not(.wg__cell--editable)`), which had equal specificity but came later in source order. Fix: added `.wg--editable` prefix to the selection row-number rules to increase specificity above the readonly rule.
- **Frozen columns: focus/selection borders bleed over frozen columns**: Cell focus outline and selection range borders were visible on top of frozen (sticky) columns when scrolling horizontally. Three root causes: (1) CSS `outline` ignores z-index stacking contexts — switched cell focus to `box-shadow: inset` which respects stacking. (2) Range/row/column selection border divs had `z-index: 3`, above frozen cells (`z-index: 1-2`) — lowered to `z-index: 0`. (3) Selected/focused frozen cells used semi-transparent backgrounds (`color-mix` with `transparent`) that let scrolling content show through — changed to mix against the opaque frozen column base color instead.
- **Inline actions header title not clearable**: Setting `inlineActionsTitle = ''` still showed "Actions" because the rendering code used `||` (which treats empty string as falsy). Fix: changed to `??` so an explicit empty string is respected while `undefined` still falls back to the default label.
- **Frozen columns: no auto-scroll when cell is behind frozen columns**: Clicking or navigating to a cell partially hidden behind frozen columns didn't scroll horizontally to reveal it. `scrollIntoView({ inline: 'nearest' })` considers the cell visible (it's in the viewport), but doesn't account for sticky columns covering it. Fix: added `ensureCellNotBehindFrozen` that checks the focused cell's left edge against the last frozen column's right edge and scrolls to reveal it. Works in both navigate mode and read-only cell selection mode.

## [1.0.0-rc14] - 2026-02-12 (Published)

### Added

- **`cellToolbarOffset` accepts CSS lengths**: In addition to numbers (0-1 fraction of cell width), now accepts CSS length strings like `'2rem'` or `'24px'` for fixed offset from cell left edge
- **Toolbar configuration warnings**: Console warnings when toolbar settings are used with incompatible `toolbarPosition` values (e.g. `toolbarVerticalAlign` with `top` position, `toolbarColumn`/`cellToolbar`/`toolbarFollowsCursor` with non-`top` positions, `toolbarColumn` + `toolbarFollowsCursor` conflict)
- **Comprehensive README** - Complete rewrite covering all features, 18 property subsections, column definitions, 8 editor types, grid modes, row toolbar, context menus, callbacks, 40+ public methods, and styling guide
- **14 new CSS variables** for granular theming control:
  - `--wg-overlay-bg`, `--wg-dialog-shadow` — Dialog/overlay styling
  - `--wg-tooltip-max-width`, `--wg-tooltip-arrow-size` — Tooltip dimensions
  - `--wg-row-number-width`, `--wg-actions-column-width` — Column sizing
  - `--wg-editor-hitbox-height` — Editor click target height
  - `--wg-toolbar-divider-height`, `--wg-toolbar-icon-size` — Toolbar element sizing
  - `--wg-dropdown-max-height` — Dropdown list height
  - `--wg-frozen-column-shadow-gradient`, `--wg-frozen-column-shadow-width` — Frozen column shadow
  - `--wg-row-locked-bg`, `--wg-row-locked-opacity` — Row locking appearance

### Changed

- **CSS variable architecture cleanup** — All `--base-*` theme variables are now consumed exclusively in `_variables.css` and mapped to `--wg-*` intermediaries. Previously `_row-locking.css` defined its own `--base-*` fallbacks in a `:host` block.
- **Hardcoded values replaced with CSS variables** — ~30 magic numbers (pixel values, rgba colors, font weights) across 12 CSS files replaced with named `--wg-*` variables for consistent theming
- **Redundant CSS fallbacks removed** — Stripped inline fallback values from `var()` calls (e.g., `var(--wg-accent-color, #0078d4)` → `var(--wg-accent-color)`) in `_cells.css`, `_dropdown.css`, `_editors.css`, `_dialogs.css`, `_toolbar.css`, `_cell-selection.css` — all variables are already defined with defaults in `_variables.css`

### Fixed

- **Toolbar position flash on row boundaries**: When hovering between rows with `toolbarFollowsCursor` or `cellToolbar` active, the toolbar would briefly flash at a wrong X position before snapping to the correct cell-offset position. Now computes the correct initial X from the cursor position inside the `computePosition` callback, so the toolbar is never visible at a wrong position.
- **`toolbarColumn` ignored when `toolbarFollowsCursor` enabled**: The mousemove handler unconditionally overrode the column-anchored position. Now `toolbarColumn` takes priority — when set, cursor following is disabled and the toolbar stays pinned to the specified column.
- **Cell toolbar showing base items on row change**: When hovering across rows on the same column, `cellToolbar` would briefly show the base `rowToolbar` items instead of the cell-specific items. Root cause: `openToolbar` rebuilt the toolbar with base items but `currentCellToolbarItems` wasn't reset, so the subsequent cell-change comparison found no difference and skipped the update.
- **Inline actions column clipped**: With `table-layout: fixed`, the inline actions column had no explicit width so buttons were cut off by `overflow: hidden`. Now computes column width from the max button count per toolbar row using CSS `calc()` with theme variables. Also left-aligned buttons to prevent zig-zag when rows have different visible button counts (due to `hidden` callbacks).
- **Inline action buttons inconsistent width**: Emoji icons could expand buttons beyond `min-width`, causing layout overflow. Buttons now use fixed `width`/`max-width` equal to `--wg-toolbar-btn-min-width` for predictable column sizing.

## [1.0.0-rc13-pre] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **`isMovable` column property**: Per-column opt-out from column reordering
  - Set `isMovable: false` on a column to prevent it from being dragged
  - Non-movable columns also block drops that would displace them (other columns can only be dropped after all non-movable columns)
- **`resetState` macro action**: New pipeline action that expands into primitive cleanup sub-actions (`cancelEdit`, `clearSelection`, `closeContextMenu`, `closeDatePicker`, `blurCell`)
  - Flags: `edit`, `selections`, `overlays` (default: true), `focus` (default: false) for partial cleanup
  - Foundation for replacing 20+ scattered manual cleanup locations with a single dispatch
- **`closeContextMenu` executor**: Pipeline executor now actually closes both cell and header context menus (was a no-op placeholder)
- **Editor alignment**: Text and number editors now respect column alignment settings
- **Checkbox scale variable**: `--wg-checkbox-scale` CSS variable to control checkbox size (default: 1.2)
- **Configuration warning**: Console warning when `editTrigger: 'always'` is used with `isEditable: false` (unsupported combination)
  - `horizontalAlign` is inherited by editors (number editor no longer hardcoded to right)
  - `verticalAlign` positions the editor input at top/middle/bottom of cell
  - Note: Text inside `<input>` elements is always vertically centered by CSS spec; the editor element itself is positioned

### Changed

- **Context menu element refs**: `contextMenuElement` and `headerContextMenuElement` are now part of `GridContext` (previously private on `GridElement`), enabling pipeline executors to access them

### Fixed

- **Toolbar position flash on row boundaries**: When hovering between rows with `toolbarFollowsCursor` or `cellToolbar` active, the toolbar would briefly flash at a wrong X position before snapping to the correct cell-offset position. Now computes the correct initial X from the cursor position inside the `computePosition` callback, so the toolbar is never visible at a wrong position.
- **Read-only mode with `editTrigger: 'always'` broken**: Switching from input-matrix mode to read-only mode caused broken state (cell selection didn't work, grid unresponsive). Root cause: `isAlwaysMode()` didn't check `isEditable`, so adapter entered "always" code path without editors. Fix: `isAlwaysMode()` now returns `false` when grid is not editable.
- **Combobox text selection in always mode**: First click on combobox now selects all text (enables quick type-to-filter workflow). Second click on already-focused combobox positions cursor for precise editing.
- **Number editor left-aligned**: Number inputs now default to right-align instead of inheriting (which defaulted to left).
- **Focus outline persists during cell selection drag**: Focus outline on the starting cell now clears immediately when drag begins (previously persisted until mouseup). If user returns to start cell or presses Escape, focus is properly restored.
- **Edit not cancelled when clicking another cell**: Clicking a non-editing cell while another cell was in dblclick/click edit mode now properly cancels the active edit (previously the edit state persisted because the pipeline only checked if the *clicked* cell was being edited)
- **Focus stuck on old cell during editor transitions**: Fixed focus outline remaining on the previously-edited cell when transitioning to a new cell via toggle click, date trigger click, or display-mode dropdown click. Root cause: `renderCell` on the old cell ran before `focusedCell` was updated, so the old cell re-rendered with the focus class. Now `setFocusedCell` is called before re-rendering in all four transition paths.
- **Editing cell outline clipped on left/right**: Fixed the blue editing outline being hidden on left and right sides. The date editor had `background: var(--wg-editor-bg)` (opaque) unlike text/number editors which use transparent backgrounds. Changed to `background: transparent` so the cell's own outline is visible. Also added `z-index: 1` to `.wg__cell--editing` to paint above neighboring cells.
- **Date input click closes editor**: In `editTrigger: 'click'` mode, clicking inside the date input to reposition the cursor would close the datepicker and exit edit mode. Two root causes: (1) the datepicker's outside-click handler used `e.target` which is retargeted to the shadow host across shadow DOM boundaries — fixed by using `composedPath()`. (2) The pipeline dispatched `focusCell` on the `<td>`, triggering `focusout` — text-like inputs in the same editing cell now skip pipeline handling entirely.
- **Date value not updated after picking**: Selecting a date from the calendar didn't update the cell's display value until the next edit. Root cause: the `onSelect` callback captured a DOM input reference that went stale on re-render. Fixed by capturing stable row/col/field values instead, and adding `renderCell` + `cell.focus()` after `commitEdit`.
- **Toggle/date trigger clicks not routed through pipeline in display mode**: Clicking a dropdown toggle or date calendar icon on a non-editing cell fell through to legacy handlers because the adapter only looked for editor containers (`.wg__editor--*`), which don't exist in display mode. Fixed by also looking in display containers (`.wg__cell-dropdown-display`, `.wg__cell-date-display`).
- **Number editor type-to-start**: Typing multiple characters (e.g., "1234") now captures all characters instead of only the first
  - Fixed transition executor to commit edit before re-rendering when navigating away from editing cell
  - Fixed adapter to not dispatch `startEdit` when cell is already being edited (allows native input handling)
- **Number editor formatting**: Values entered via keyboard are now saved as numbers (not strings), so `formatCallback` works correctly
- **'Always' mode focus**: Focus visual updates no longer re-render cells in `editTrigger: 'always'` mode (preserves typed content)
- **Click/dblclick editTrigger modes**: Fixed click and double-click edit triggers not working
  - Focus visual updates no longer re-render click/dblclick mode cells (prevents DOM replacement between mousedown and click)
  - Click events now calculate cursor position for `editStartSelection: 'mousePosition'`
  - Fixed "every 3rd click ignored" bug by checking `editingCell` instead of `focusedCell` when cleaning up old editor
  - Fixed blue editing border lingering on old cell when clicking to new cell (cancel edit before re-rendering)
- **Text/number editor vertical text shift**: Fixed text shifting down 1-2px when entering edit mode
  - Root cause: `--valign-middle` used `top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)` which centered the input box, but input text is always vertically centered within the input's height, causing a mismatch with display mode
  - Fix: Changed to `top: 0; bottom: 0` so input fills the cell height; input's natural text centering now matches table cell's `vertical-align: middle`
  - Affected CSS: `_editors.css` `.wg__editor--valign-middle`
- **Fill handle drag**: Now respects row locking - locked/read-only rows are skipped during fill operations
- Filler column cells now fire `cellClick` events with correct `rowIndex` (and `colIndex: -1`)
- **Datepicker keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End, Enter, Escape, and Tab now work correctly when the calendar is open (previously intercepted by grid's table listener)
  - Fixed pipeline `Object.create` pattern shadowing property mutations - changed to `Proxy` so `ctx.datepicker` is set on the original context
  - Fixed async dispatch not working in callbacks - `ctx.dispatch()` now triggers new dispatch cycles for async scenarios like datepicker's `onSelect`
  - Added keyboard bypass in both adapter and table listener when datepicker is open
  - Focus now restored to cell after closing datepicker with Escape
- **Read-only cells**: Dropdown/date toggles no longer appear on non-editable cells (column `isEditable: false` or locked rows)
  - Toggle visibility now respects both column editability and row locking via `canEditCell()`
  - Clicking where toggle would be on read-only cells no longer opens editors
- **Dropdown Escape key behavior**: Improved two-phase Escape handling for all dropdown editors
  - **Select**: First Escape clears type-to-filter and shows all options; second Escape exits edit mode
  - **Autocomplete/Combobox**: First Escape restores original value and shows all options; second Escape exits edit mode
  - Implemented via new `escapeEdit` action in event pipeline
- **Row selection focus cleanup**: Clicking row numbers now clears cell focus visual
- **Navigation keys when dropdown open**: Navigation keys no longer move between cells when a dropdown is open
  - ArrowLeft/ArrowRight: For autocomplete, fall through to browser for cursor movement; for select/combobox, consumed via `noop`
- **Checkbox editor click mode**: Clicking checkbox to toggle value no longer exits edit mode immediately
  - Added `updateDraftValue()` method to update cell value without exiting edit mode
  - Checkbox can now be toggled multiple times while staying in edit mode
  - Standard exit methods (click elsewhere, Tab, Enter, Escape) still work as expected
  - Home/End: For autocomplete, cursor movement; for select/combobox, jump to first/last option
  - PageUp/PageDown: Jump through dropdown options by 10 items (all dropdown editors)
- **Dropdown not opening on first click**: Fixed dropdown editors (select/combobox/autocomplete/date) not opening on first click in `editTrigger: 'click'` mode
  - Root cause: Multiple click handlers on table element - adapter opened dropdown, then legacy handler toggled it closed
  - Fix: Use `stopImmediatePropagation()` to prevent other listeners on same element from firing
- **Double-click edit for complex editors**: Fixed double-click not entering edit mode on dropdown, date, combobox, and autocomplete cells
  - Display containers now use `pointer-events: none` so clicks pass through to the cell
  - Toggle buttons retain `pointer-events: auto` so they remain directly clickable
- **Cursor repositioning in text/number editors**: Single clicks inside text and number inputs now correctly reposition the cursor instead of being blocked by `preventDefault()`
- **Combobox/autocomplete text selection**: Double-clicking to edit combobox/autocomplete cells now selects all text by default, regardless of grid-level `editStartSelection` setting
  - Dropdown-type inputs default to `selectAll` since cursor positioning doesn't apply to filter inputs
  - Can still be overridden per-column via `editorOptions.editStartSelection`
- **Checkbox editor display**: Fixed checkbox rendering issues
  - Checkbox now vertically and horizontally centered in cell (was positioned at top)
  - Display mode now renders checkbox instead of "true"/"false" text
- **Autocomplete editor improvements**:
  - Cursor position now calculated correctly when clicking (was always at end)
  - Local filtering now works when no `searchCallback` is provided (filters `initialOptions` like combobox)
- **Dropdown display value consistency**: Display mode and edit mode now show the same value
  - Display mode now uses proper fallback chain: `getDisplayCallback` → `displayMember` → `label` → raw value
  - Previously display mode showed raw value ("USA") while edit mode showed label ("United States")
  - Escape key now compares against display value for consistent restore behavior
- **Fill handle disappearing on multi-grid pages**: Fixed fill handle vanishing when clicking between multiple grids
  - Root cause: Fill handle is module-level singleton; one grid's cleanup handlers removed another grid's handle
  - Fix: Track ownership of fill handle; only the owning grid can remove it
- **Right-click triggering selection on headers/row numbers**: Right-clicking column headers or row numbers no longer triggers selection (regression from pipeline refactor)
- **Frozen column headers lacking visual distinction**: Frozen column headers now have a subtle accent color tint to differentiate them from regular columns
- **`isResizable` example typo**: Fixed example using wrong property name (`resizable` → `isResizable`)
- **Sticky header bottom border disappearing**: Fixed header bottom border becoming invisible when scrolling with sticky headers
  - Root cause: With `border-collapse: collapse`, real borders get overlapped when content scrolls underneath
  - Fix: Changed to `box-shadow` which always paints on top regardless of scroll position
- **Dropdown not opening on click/double-click**: Fixed dropdown editors (select/combobox/autocomplete) not opening when clicking or double-clicking to start edit, when `showOnFocus: false` was set in editorOptions
  - Root cause: Pipeline adapter incorrectly checked `showOnFocus` setting for explicit edit actions
  - Fix: `showOnFocus: false` now only prevents auto-open on Tab/focus navigation, not on explicit edit actions (click, double-click, F2, Space, Enter)
- **Checkbox editor keyboard navigation**: Fixed multiple keyboard issues with checkbox editor
  - **Enter/Tab not working after toggle**: After toggling a checkbox with Space, Enter and Tab keys were not registered. Root cause: `renderCell()` replaced the checkbox HTML but didn't restore focus, so keyboard events had no target. Fix: Added `{ focusEditor: true }` to re-focus checkbox after toggle.
  - **Tab required two presses**: Tab key only navigated on second press because `toggleCheckbox` didn't set `editingCell`. Fix: Checkbox toggle now calls `startEdit()` to integrate with standard editing flow.
  - **Enter on last row caused stuck state**: Pressing Enter on the last row had nowhere to navigate, so edit was never committed. Fix: Navigate executor now commits edit and keeps focus on current cell when there's no navigation target.
  - **Escape didn't discard changes**: Pressing Escape after toggling didn't restore the original value. Fix: Added `discardCellDraft()` method and integrated with cancel/escape handlers for checkbox editor.
  - **Arrow keys navigated during edit**: Arrow keys moved between cells while checkbox was in edit mode. Fix: Arrow keys now return `noop` action for checkbox editor, matching other editor behavior.

## [1.0.0-rc12] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Table Border Only Mode**: New `tableBorderOnly` property for cleaner card integration
  - `tableBorderOnly: boolean` - When `true`, border only wraps the table, pagination/toolbar float outside (default: `false`)
  - Eliminates double-border issue when grid is inside a card component
  - Table wrapped in `.wg__table-container` with border; outer `.wg` container is borderless
  - Pagination and toolbar remain in outer container, visually separate from table

- **Scroll behavior properties**: New `isScrollable` and `scrollMaxHeight` properties for grids without a height-constrained container
  - `isScrollable: boolean` - When `true`, constrains grid to viewport height (default: `false`)
  - `scrollMaxHeight: string` - Custom max-height when scrollable (default: `'100vh'`)
  - Use when grid is not inside a container with explicit `max-height` but still needs to scroll

- **Paste from clipboard**: Multi-cell paste from Excel/TSV clipboard data
  - Automatically detects TSV format (tabs, newlines) from clipboard
  - **Header detection**: If first row matches column titles/fields (>50%), maps data by column name
  - **Position-based paste**: Without headers, pastes starting from focused cell position
  - **New row creation**: Automatically creates rows when pasting beyond existing data
  - `createRowCallback` - Custom row factory for new rows (default: plain object with pasted values)
  - `pasteMode` property - How to handle non-editable columns:
    - `'skip-non-editable'` (default) - Skip non-editable cells
    - `'all-columns'` - Paste into all columns regardless of editable flag
    - `'editable-only'` - Only paste if all target columns are editable
  - `shouldValidateOnPaste` property - Run validation on pasted values (default: true)
  - `onbeforepaste` event - Cancel or modify paste operation before it executes
  - `onpaste` event - Summary after paste completes with success/failure counts
  - Respects column `beforePasteCallback` for value transformation
  - Respects row locking - locked rows are skipped

- **Row Focus (Master/Detail)**: `onrowfocus` event fires when a different row is focused via cell click/focus — ideal for master/detail layouts
  - `onrowfocus` callback: `{ rowIndex, row, previousRowIndex }`
  - `focusedRowIndex` getter/setter for programmatic control (set to `null` to clear)
  - `isRowFocused(rowIndex)` method to check focus state
  - Visual: focused row gets `--wg-row-focus-bg` background, row number gets `--wg-row-focus-row-number-bg` (30% accent tint)
  - Row number clicks do **not** trigger focus (they handle row selection)
  - Clicking outside the grid clears row focus
  - Surgical DOM updates preserve cell focus (no full re-render)

- **🧪 New Row (Inline Data Entry) [Experimental]**: Always-visible empty row for adding data directly in the grid
  - `isNewRowEnabled: boolean` - Enable the empty row (default: `false`, requires navigate mode)
  - `newRowPosition: 'top' | 'bottom'` - Where to show the empty row (default: `'bottom'`)
  - `newRowIndicator: string` - Indicator in row number column (default: `'+'`)
  - `createEmptyRowCallback: () => T | Promise<T>` - Factory for new row objects (supports async)
  - Tab moves between cells within the empty row (saves to draft, doesn't commit)
  - Tab on last editable cell commits the row (if it has data) and starts a fresh empty row
  - Enter commits the row if it has any data
  - Lenient validation: tracks errors but doesn't block input (rows can be committed with invalid cells)
  - Paste support: pasting into the empty row creates new rows
  - **Note:** This feature is experimental and may change in future releases

- **Select All**: Click the `#` row number header to select all cells in the grid
  - `selectAll()` method for programmatic selection
  - Visual feedback: cursor changes to pointer, hover highlight on header

- **Column Selection**: Click column headers to select entire columns (like row selection)
  - `selectColumn(colIndex, mode)` method - modes: 'replace', 'toggle', 'range'
  - `isColumnSelected(colIndex)` method to check selection state
  - `selectedColumns` getter returns sorted array of selected column indices
  - `clearColumnSelection()` method
  - `copySelectedColumnsToClipboard()` method - copy all rows for selected columns
  - Click header = select single column (replaces previous)
  - Ctrl+Click = toggle individual columns (non-contiguous selection)
  - Shift+Click = select range from last clicked column
  - Escape = clear column selection
  - Ctrl+C = copy selected columns to clipboard
  - Visual: selected headers get accent background (like row numbers), cells get selection background
  - No border (matches row selection visual style)
  - Sort moved to sort indicator only (▲/▼/⬍) - clicking header body selects column
  - Mutual exclusivity: row, column, and cell range selections clear each other

- **Row/Column Selection Borders**: Visual borders around selected rows and columns for better visibility
  - Border appears around selected row/column range (similar to cell range selection)
  - Handles non-contiguous selections: separate borders for each contiguous segment (e.g., rows 1-2 and 5-7 show two borders)
  - Row border starts from first data column (excludes row number column)
  - Column border spans from header to last data row
  - Borders update on scroll to stay positioned correctly
  - CSS variables: `--wg-selection-border-width`, `--wg-selection-border-color`

- **Column Drag Selection**: When column reorder is disabled, drag on headers to select column ranges
  - Same UX as row drag selection on row numbers
  - Click + drag = select range of columns
  - 5px drag threshold before activating (prevents accidental selection)
  - Ctrl+click = toggle individual columns
  - Shift+click = range from last selected
  - `selectColumnRange(fromIndex, toIndex)` method for programmatic range selection
  - Cursor changes to `col-resize` during drag
  - Only active when `isColumnReorderAllowed = false` (doesn't conflict with column reordering)

### Changed

- **Click Event Manager**: Introduced `ClickEventManager` (pub/sub pattern) for centralized click handling, following the same pattern as `ScrollEventManager` and `FocusEventManager`. Outside-click detection for selection clearing now uses this unified system.
- **Sort Event Pipeline**: Sort indicator clicks now use the `ClickEventManager` pub/sub pattern (`sortClick` event type). This allows modules to subscribe to sort events and follows the same architecture as other event pipelines.

### Fixed

- **Date picker two-click with selection active**: Fixed date picker requiring two clicks when a row/column/cell selection was active. Moved selection clearing before cell edit transition to prevent render from interfering with date picker opening.
- **Dropdown/editor not closing on outside click**: Fixed dropdowns (select, combobox, autocomplete) and editors staying open/focused when clicking outside the grid. Outside-click handler now explicitly closes dropdowns, cancels edits, clears focused cell state and visual class.
- **Column selection with modifier keys when reorder enabled**: Fixed Ctrl+click and Shift+click not working for column selection when `isColumnReorderAllowed = true`. Reorder now skips when modifier keys are held, allowing column toggle/range selection.
- **Column selection after reorder**: Fixed issue where clicking a column header after reordering required two clicks. The `dragJustCompleted` flag now auto-clears after the current frame.
- **Selected header hover state**: Fixed unreadable text when hovering over selected column headers (gray background + white text). Selected headers now maintain accent styling on hover.
- **Selection clearing on click**: Row and column selections now clear when clicking on data cells or clicking outside the grid. Clicking row numbers preserves row selection, clicking headers preserves column selection.
- **Selected row number styling in navigate mode**: Fixed selected row numbers not showing correct colors (white text on accent background) when using `editTrigger: 'navigate'`. Increased CSS specificity to ensure selection styles win.
- **Shift+drag cell selection**: Fixed shift+drag cell selection not working when `editTrigger: 'click'` combined with `cellSelectionMode: 'shift'`. Simplified selection logic to handle all editTrigger combinations.
- **Frozen cell selection visibility**: Fixed row, column, and cell range selections not showing on frozen columns. Added CSS rules with `!important` to ensure selection backgrounds override frozen cell styling.
- **Frozen row number selection color**: Fixed selected row number cells showing wrong background color (light blue instead of accent) when row numbers are sticky/frozen.
- **Frozen header selection**: Fixed selected column headers not showing accent color when frozen.
- **Selection clearing with cell selection mode**: Fixed row/column selections not clearing when clicking on cells in grids with `cellSelectionMode: 'click'` (the default). The early return in cell selection handling now clears row/column selections first.
- **Dropdown toggle click with cell selection**: Fixed dropdown/date toggles not responding to clicks when `cellSelectionMode: 'click'`. Toggle clicks are now excluded from cell selection logic so they properly trigger their own handlers.
- **Dropdown not closing on cell selection**: Fixed dropdown staying open when clicking another cell to start cell selection. Active edit is now properly canceled (dropdown closed, cell re-rendered to display mode) before starting selection.
- **Cell selection cleared on any click**: Fixed cell selection being incorrectly cleared on any click due to shadow DOM detection issue in `outsideClick` handler. Now correctly checks if host element is in event's composed path.
- **Cell selection cleared on sort click**: Fixed cell selection being cleared when clicking sort indicator. The `render()` call after sorting was rebuilding the DOM, causing the document click handler to misdetect the click as outside the grid. Click event manager now tracks inside-grid clicks via a flag set on mousedown, and the listener is attached to the host element (not container) so it survives re-renders.
- **Shadow DOM event target retargeting**: Fixed click event manager not detecting clicked elements correctly. When events cross the shadow DOM boundary to the host element listener, `event.target` gets retargeted to the host. Now uses `composedPath()[0]` to get the actual clicked element inside the shadow DOM.
- **Click event subscription accumulation**: Fixed endless loop when clicking sort indicator. `attachEventListeners()` is called on every `render()`, causing subscriptions to accumulate. Added `clickEventsSubscribed` flag to ensure click event subscriptions are only registered once.
- **Sort handler shadow DOM compatibility**: Fixed sort clicks not working due to `handleSortClick` using `event.target` which is retargeted when crossing shadow DOM. Now passes the field directly from the click context instead of extracting it from the event.
- **Cell selection not cleared on sort**: Fixed cell selection remaining visible after clicking sort indicator. Now clears cell selection before sorting, matching behavior of other header interactions like column selection.
- **Selection not cleared on date picker open**: Fixed row/column/cell selections remaining visible when opening a date picker. All selections and borders are now cleared when the date picker opens.
- **Selection not cleared on resize/reorder**: Fixed row/column/cell selections remaining visible when starting column resize or reorder operations. Added `clearAllSelections()` helper method that clears all selection types and their visual borders.
- **Selection not clearing on first outside click after drag**: Fixed cell/row/column selections requiring two clicks outside the grid to clear after drag-selecting. The `insideGridClickInProgress` flag was set on mousedown but only cleared on click - drag operations (mousedown → mousemove → mouseup) don't produce a click event, leaving the flag stuck. Added mouseup handler with 10ms timeout to clear the flag after drags.
- **Blur and outsideClick handlers conflicting**: Fixed race condition where blur handlers and outsideClick handler both tried to handle cleanup when clicking outside the grid, causing inconsistent state. Blur handler now checks if focus is leaving the grid entirely (`relatedTarget` is null or outside shadow DOM) and defers all cleanup to the outsideClick handler in that case.

## [1.0.0-rc11] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **Copy to clipboard**: Cell range and row selections can now be copied to clipboard in TSV format (Excel-compatible)
  - `copyCellSelectionToClipboard()` - Copy selected cell range
  - `copySelectedRowsToClipboard()` - Copy selected rows
  - `shouldCopyWithHeaders` property - Include column headers when copying (default: false)
  - Works with Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut via `rangeShortcuts`

### Fixed

- **Cell range selection border alignment**: Fixed 1px offset caused by container border (getBoundingClientRect measures from border edge, position:absolute from padding edge)
- **Focus border during drag**: Focus outline now properly hides when starting a cell range drag selection
- **Selection focus timing**: Improved focus reliability when multiple grids are on the same page using double requestAnimationFrame

## [1.0.0-rc10] - 2026-01-13 (Published)

### BREAKING CHANGES

This release contains significant API changes to align property naming with sibling components (web-multiselect, web-daterangepicker) and follow consistent naming conventions. Since this is a new library, no backwards compatibility layer is provided.

#### Grid-Level Property Renames

All boolean properties now use `is*` prefix for state properties and `should*` prefix for behavior configuration:

| Old Property | New Property | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `filterable` | `isFilterable` | Enable column filtering UI |
| `pageable` | `isPageable` | Enable pagination |
| `striped` | `isStriped` | Alternate row background colors |
| `hoverable` | `isHoverable` | Highlight row on hover |
| `editable` | `isEditable` | Enable cell editing |
| `showRowNumbers` | `isRowNumbersVisible` | Show row number column |
| `stickyRowNumbers` | `isStickyRowNumbers` | Pin row numbers when scrolling horizontally |
| `showRowToolbar` | `isRowToolbarVisible` | Show row toolbar on hover |
| `showShortcutsHelp` | `isShortcutsHelpVisible` | Show keyboard shortcuts info icon |
| `virtualScroll` | `isVirtualScrollEnabled` | Enable virtual scrolling for large datasets |
| `infiniteScroll` | `isInfiniteScrollEnabled` | Enable infinite scroll loading |
| `persistColumnWidths` | `shouldPersistColumnWidths` | Save column widths to localStorage |
| `persistColumnOrder` | `shouldPersistColumnOrder` | Save column order to localStorage |
| `allowColumnReorder` | `isColumnReorderAllowed` | Allow drag-to-reorder columns |
| `checkboxAlwaysEditable` | `isCheckboxAlwaysEditable` | Checkboxes toggle without entering edit mode |
| `dropdownShowOnFocus` | `shouldShowDropdownOnFocus` | Open dropdown when cell receives focus |
| `openDropdownOnEnter` | `shouldOpenDropdownOnEnter` | Open dropdown on Enter key |
| `summaryInline` | `isSummaryInline` | Show summary row inline vs footer |

**Migration example:**
```javascript
// Before
grid.editable = true
grid.showRowNumbers = true
grid.virtualScroll = true

// After
grid.isEditable = true
grid.isRowNumbersVisible = true
grid.isVirtualScrollEnabled = true
```

#### Column-Level Property Renames

| Old Property | New Property | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `sortable` | `isSortable` | Column can be sorted |
| `filterable` | `isFilterable` | Column can be filtered |
| `editable` | `isEditable` | Column cells can be edited |
| `frozen` | `isFrozen` | Column stays fixed when scrolling |
| `resizable` | `isResizable` | Column width can be resized |
| `hidden` | `isHidden` | Column is hidden from view |
| `showEditButton` | `isEditButtonVisible` | Show edit button in cell |
| `openDropdownOnEnter` | `shouldOpenDropdownOnEnter` | Open dropdown on Enter key |

**Migration example:**
```javascript
// Before
const columns = [
  { field: 'id', title: 'ID', editable: false, frozen: true },
  { field: 'name', title: 'Name', sortable: true },
  { field: 'status', title: 'Status', hidden: true }
]

// After
const columns = [
  { field: 'id', title: 'ID', isEditable: false, isFrozen: true },
  { field: 'name', title: 'Name', isSortable: true },
  { field: 'status', title: 'Status', isHidden: true }
]
```

#### Callback Renames

Per naming convention: Events (`on*`) = fire-and-forget, Callbacks (`*Callback`) = return value affects behavior.

| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `onfilldrag` | `fillDragCallback` | Returns `false` to cancel fill operation |
| `onSearchCallback` (in editorOptions) | `searchCallback` | Returns search results array |

**Migration example:**
```javascript
// Before
grid.onfilldrag = (detail) => {
  if (detail.targetCells.length > 10) return false
}

// After
grid.fillDragCallback = (detail) => {
  if (detail.targetCells.length > 10) return false
}

// Before (in column editorOptions)
editorOptions: {
  onSearchCallback: async (query) => searchAPI(query)
}

// After
editorOptions: {
  searchCallback: async (query) => searchAPI(query)
}
```

### Added

- **Column `maxLines` Property** - Limit visible text lines with CSS line-clamp. When `textOverflow: 'wrap'` is set, use `maxLines: 3` to show at most 3 lines with ellipsis for overflow.

- **`horizontalAlign: 'justify'`** - New alignment option for justified text in cells and headers.

- **Header Vertical Alignment** - Header text now properly respects `verticalAlign` column property (`top`, `middle`, `bottom`) via flexbox alignment classes.

- **`--wg-header-min-height` CSS Variable** - Control minimum header row height.

- **Escape Key Cancels Fill Drag** - Press Escape while dragging the fill handle to cancel the operation without applying values to cells.

- **Component-Specific CSS Variables** - New granular CSS variables following the pattern `--wg-{component}-{property}`:

  **Dropdown Menu:**
  - `--wg-dropdown-option-gap` - Gap between option icon and text
  - `--wg-dropdown-option-padding` - Padding inside dropdown options
  - `--wg-dropdown-empty-padding` - Padding for "No options" message

  **Inline Actions:**
  - `--wg-inline-actions-padding` - Padding around inline action buttons
  - `--wg-inline-actions-gap` - Gap between action buttons

  **Toolbar:**
  - `--wg-toolbar-row-gap` - Gap between toolbar rows
  - `--wg-toolbar-row-padding` - Padding inside toolbar rows
  - `--wg-toolbar-label-font-size` - Font size for toolbar button labels
  - `--wg-toolbar-btn-gap` - Gap between toolbar buttons

  **Tooltip:**
  - `--wg-tooltip-padding` - Padding inside tooltips
  - `--wg-tooltip-shadow` - Box shadow for tooltip popups

### Changed

- **CSS Variable References** - Internal CSS now uses component-specific variables instead of generic spacing variables, making customization more targeted and predictable
- **Internal Method Names** - Grid class internal methods renamed to match new property names (e.g., `getEffectiveOpenDropdownOnEnter` → `getEffectiveShouldOpenDropdownOnEnter`)

### Fixed

- **Frozen Column Text Overflow** - Resizing frozen columns to narrow widths now properly shows ellipsis instead of text spilling out. The shadow scroll indicator still appears correctly when scrolling horizontally.

- **Fill Handle Focus State** - Fill handle now properly removed when clicking outside the grid. Fixed issue where multiple cells could appear focused when rapidly clicking between cells.

- **Consistent API Surface** - All boolean properties now follow consistent `is*`/`should*` naming pattern across grid and column levels
- **TypeScript Types** - All type definitions updated to reflect new property names
- **Example Files** - Fixed incorrect property names in example HTML files (`persistColumnWidths` → `shouldPersistColumnWidths`, `allowColumnReorder` → `isColumnReorderAllowed`, `showRowToolbar` → `isRowToolbarVisible`, etc.)

---

## [1.0.0-rc09] - 2026-01-11 (Published)

### Changed
- **Non-Resizable Column Cursor** - Columns with `resizable: false` now show `not-allowed` cursor instead of hiding the resize handle entirely. This provides visual feedback that the column exists but cannot be resized.

### Fixed
- **Column Reorder Header Transparency** - Dragging a column header no longer shows body cell content through the header when scrolled down. Changed from `opacity: 0.5` to opaque background with dashed outline indicator.
- **Column Reorder Drop Indicator Position** - The blue drop indicator line now correctly positions based on scroll offset, staying visible in the viewport when scrolled down.
- **Filler Header Sticky Positioning** - The filler `<th>` element now has proper `position: sticky` and `z-index` to match other header cells when scrolling.
- **Frozen Column Border Bleed** - Freezing columns no longer adds vertical separators to all frozen cells. Only the last frozen column now has the separator border.
- **Context Menu Divider Items** - Standalone `{ dividerBefore: true }` markers now correctly apply dividers to the next item instead of rendering as "undefined" menu items.
- **Hide Column Synced with Column Visibility** - The `'hideColumn'` action now sets `column.hidden = true` instead of removing the column from the array, keeping it synced with the Column Visibility submenu.

### Added
- **Header Context Menu** - Right-click context menu for column headers
  - `headerContextMenu` property accepts array of predefined strings or custom items
  - Predefined actions: `'sortAsc'`, `'sortDesc'`, `'clearSort'`, `'hideColumn'`, `'freezeColumn'`, `'unfreezeColumn'`, `'columnVisibility'`
  - String shorthand for predefined actions (same pattern as row toolbar)

- **Context Menu Submenus** - Menu items can now have nested submenus
  - `children` property for static submenu items
  - `submenu` callback for dynamic submenu generation
  - Submenus appear on hover with arrow indicator
- **Column Visibility Submenu** - New `'columnVisibility'` predefined action
  - Shows submenu with all columns and "Show all" option at top
  - Toggle column visibility with checkboxes (☑ visible, ☐ hidden)
  - "Show all" checkbox reflects whether all columns are visible
  - Menu stays open for multiple toggles with reactive checkbox updates
  - All labels translatable via `labels.contextMenu.*`
- **Header Filler Context Menu** - Right-clicking the empty header filler cell shows column-agnostic menu items (e.g., Column Visibility)
- **Context Menu Close on Scroll** - Context menus automatically close when page is scrolled
- **Translatable Context Menu Labels** - All predefined header context menu labels are now translatable via `labels.contextMenu.*` (`sortAsc`, `sortDesc`, `clearSort`, `hideColumn`, `freezeColumn`, `unfreezeColumn`, `columnVisibility`, `showAll`)
- **Multi-Sort via Context Menu** - Ctrl+clicking Sort Ascending/Descending in the header context menu adds to existing sort (when `sortMode === 'multi'`) instead of replacing it, matching Ctrl+click behavior on header cells
- **Column Hidden Property** - `column.hidden` property to show/hide columns
  - Hidden columns are excluded from rendering but kept in columns array
  - Allows toggling visibility without losing column configuration
- **Virtual Scroll + Reorder + Resize Demo** - New example combining virtual scrolling (10,000 rows), column reordering, and column resizing in `examples-resizable-columns.html`.

### Changed
- **Centralized Interaction State** - Refactored hover/focus/edit state tracking

  - `grid.hoveredRowIndex` getter for reading hovered row
  - `grid.setHoveredRow()` method for updating hover state
  - Internal `_onInteractionChange` callback for state change notifications
  - Enables future features like "shortcuts on focused row when no hover"
- **Readonly Cell Background** - `--wg-cell-readonly-bg` now uses `var(--base-disabled-bg, var(--wg-surface-2))` instead of `var(--wg-surface-2)`, providing visual distinction from striped rows when theme-designer's `--base-disabled-bg` is set
- **Toolbar Positioning** - Refactored to use floating-ui library for better space detection and automatic fallback positioning
- **Font Inheritance** - Changed default font-family fallback from `system-ui, sans-serif` to `inherit`, allowing grid to inherit font from parent context (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- **Form Element Fonts** - Added `font-family: inherit` to all form elements (buttons, inputs, selects) that don't inherit by default
- **Line Height** - Changed `--wg-line-height-base` from absolute value (`2 * --wg-rem` = 20px) to unitless multiplier (`1.5`), matching web-multiselect and standard CSS best practices
- **Font Size Alignment** - Aligned font size scale with web-multiselect and web-daterangepicker: `--wg-font-size-base` now uses `--base-font-size-sm` (14px) instead of `--base-font-size-base` (16px), ensuring consistent text size across all KeenMate components

### Removed
- **Deprecated `sortable` Property** - The grid-level `sortable` boolean property has been removed
  - Use `sortMode` instead: `'none'` (disabled), `'single'` (one column), `'multi'` (multi-column with Ctrl+click)
  - Migration: `grid.sortable = true` → `grid.sortMode = 'multi'`
  - Column-level `sortable` property (to disable sorting per column) is unchanged

### Fixed
- **Cross-Column Dropdown Bug** - Rapidly clicking between dropdown cells in different columns no longer opens dropdown on wrong cell. Fixed generic selectors to use specific `data-row`/`data-field` attributes.
- **Dropdown Toggle Stays Visible After Scroll** - Scrolling while dropdown is open now properly re-renders the cell to remove editor HTML (toggle button)
- **Datepicker Stays Open When Switching Cells** - Datepicker now auto-closes silently when its anchor becomes disconnected (e.g., clicking another cell)
- **Focus Border Not Cleared** - Clicking a dropdown toggle while another cell is focused now clears the focus border from the old cell
- **Autocomplete Stuck at "Searching..."** - Empty search results now correctly show "No options" instead of staying at "Searching..."
- **Virtual Scroll Flickering on Keyboard Navigation** - Pressing Ctrl+PageDown, Ctrl+Home, PageUp/Down no longer causes grid to flicker/redraw multiple times. Keyboard navigation now pre-renders target row range once before scrolling, with flag to skip redundant scroll event handlers.
- **Edit Mode Full Re-render** - Entering and exiting edit mode (click, F2, Enter, Tab, Escape) no longer causes full grid re-render. Uses surgical DOM updates to replace only the cell content, preserving any DevTools modifications to other cells.
- **Focus Following Row on Move** - `focusCell()` now updates state synchronously before render, fixing focus not following row when using keyboard shortcuts to move rows up/down
- **Enter Key Blocked After Date Picker** - Fixed `this.datepicker` not being set to null after date selection, which caused Enter key to be blocked in other editors
- **Connector Arrow Clipping** - Connector arrow now clips at grid container boundaries instead of drawing outside the container
- **Connector Scroll Updates** - Connector arrow updates in real-time when scrolling, pointing to container edge when row scrolls out of view
- **Connector Right Position** - When toolbar is on right side, connector now correctly points to the right side of the row (not always left)
- **Connector Scrollbar Overlap** - Connector uses container bounds instead of table bounds, avoiding overlap with scrollbar
- **Connector Visibility Check** - Row is only considered "not visible" when completely outside container (not just when center is outside)
- **Cursor Anchor Bug** - Cursor-based positioning only applies when `toolbarPosition="top"`, not for left/right positions

## [1.0.0-rc04] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Validation Error Tooltips** - Invalid cells now show validation error message as tooltip on hover
- **Rich Validation Tooltips** - New `validationTooltipCallback` for custom HTML error tooltips
  - Grid-level: `grid.validationTooltipCallback = ({ field, error, value, row, rowIndex }) => htmlString`
  - Column-level: `column.validationTooltipCallback = (ctx) => htmlString` (overrides grid-level)
  - Context object provides `field`, `error`, `value`, `row`, `rowIndex`
  - Return HTML string for rich formatting (you must escape user values for XSS safety)

### Changed
- **CSS Base Variables** - Updated to align with Pure Admin theme system
  - `--base-main-bg` instead of `--base-surface-1`
  - `--base-elevated-bg` instead of `--base-surface-2`

  - `editStartSelection="cursorAtEnd"` - Cursor at end
  - Can be set at grid level or per-column via `editorOptions.editStartSelection`

### Changed
- **Sort Mode** - New `sortMode` property replaces `sortable` boolean
  - `sortMode="none"` - Sorting disabled (default)
  - `sortMode="single"` - Single column sorting only
  - `sortMode="multi"` - Multi-column sorting with Ctrl+Click
  - `sortable` property is now deprecated but still works as an alias

### Fixed
- **Edit Trigger Click** - `editTrigger="click"` now works correctly
  - Single click starts editing immediately
  - Clicking another cell while editing transitions directly to the new cell (no double-click needed)
